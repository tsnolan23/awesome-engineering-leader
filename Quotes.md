![Try Catch Support](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/059ed269-99ee-410c-8dfe-1d36e7c0a0c0)

> Support is like a try/catch statement. Users go for the try block first, which includes the product, documentation, and examples.
>
> If the try block fails, users move to the catch block.
>
> Just like in engineering, the catch block isn't the goal. Truly great support is actually about improving the try block.
